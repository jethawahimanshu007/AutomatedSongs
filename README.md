# FreeStyle
This application is an easy way to make a freestyle song for any occasion, 
without the hassle of thinking about the whole lyrics and even the music selection!
 It takes a user to a web link which asks the user for his/her likes, dislikes, place, friends, etc.
 These entities are then included in the song on that website. 
 The user can then choose one of the three instrumental tracks that are available in the app. 
 Once the user selects the track, he/she can press on "Play" button and the track will play along with the text-to-speech 
 version of the song. There is an option for adjusting the speed of Text-to-Speech so as to synchronize it to the music.
